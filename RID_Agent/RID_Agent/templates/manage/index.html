{% block content %}
<p>This section contains the management functions for the RID Agent.</p>
<p>List of things I would like to ultimately provide:
<ul>
  <li>Manage Peer SSL Certificates</li>
  <li>Enable/Disable SSL validation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Ideally I will provide web interfaces to perform each of these tasks. 
Instructions on how to perform the tasks manually is acceptable.</p>
