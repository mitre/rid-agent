<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The Web API is the mechanism through which backend systems integrate 
with the RID Agent, specifically by hooking into the 
<a href="/docs/message_store">message store</a> component. The full
context for the message store is described in the 
<a href="/docs/architecture">architecture</a> section.</p>

<p>There are two message store URLs that any integration effort must
know about: /msg/incoming/pull and /msg/outgoing/push. For human
interaction through a browser, both of these urls can be accessed 
by replacing pull or push with 'view':<br>
<ul>
 <li><a href="/msg/incoming/view">/msg/incoming/view</a></li>
 <li><a href="/msg/outgoing/view/">/msg/outgoing/view</a></li>
</ul>
Note: If you have not sent or received any RID messages, these queues will be empty.
You may choose to insert some Sample XML from the
<a href="/docs/references">references</a> page, using the 
<a href="/tools/add_incoming_message">add incoming message</a> tool.
</p>
<h2><a name="workflow">Workflows</a></h2>
<p>
<b>Receive and Respond</b><br>
The workflow for a Receiving and responding to RID Message is as follows:
<ol>
  <li>A RID Message gets added to the RID Agent message store. This 
  may be done through the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6546.txt">
  RID Transport protocol</a> or the 
  <a href="/tools/add_incoming_message">add incoming message tool</a>.</li>
  <li>The backend system polls messages from the incoming message store using
      /msg/incoming/pull. The RID Agent does not have the ability to push
      incoming RID Messages. Incoming RID Messages must be pulled from the queue.
      </li>
  <li>The backend system parses the incoming RID Message and generates a response
      RID Message. The backend system is responsible for understanding the context
      of the RID Message.</li>
  <li>The backend system posts a response RID Message (if necessary)
      to the outgoing message queue.</li>
  <li>The RID Agent communicates the response RID Message to the target</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>Send</b><br>
The workflow for sending a RID Message is as follows:
<ol>
   <li>A RID Message is created by the backend system and 
       is inserted into the outgoing mesage store through
       the Web API</li>
   <li>The RID Agent sends the RID Message to the appropriate target.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2><a name="incoming">Incoming Messages</a></h2>
<p>
Incoming Messages are RID Messages that have been sent to the RID Agent. 
RID Messages are recieved via the RID Transport protocol or artificially added
via the <a href="/tools/add_incoming_message">add incoming message tool</a>.
</p>
<p>
Incoming Messages are accessed by using the /msg/incoming/pull or 
/msg/incoming/view URLs. <b>The pull URL changes the state of the 
incoming message store</b>. The view URL does not. The pull 
URL is intended for use by systems and the view URL is inteded
for use by humans using a web browser or by systems testing 
integration.
</p>
<p>HTTP Requests to /msg/incoming/(pull|view) MUST be done with
an HTTP GET. All other HTTP requests will be denied. Valid queries
will be responded to with XML by default, or as an HTML table
if specified. All valid GET parameters are documented in
/msg/incoming/view. Optionally add a view_type=html GET parameter
to view the incoming messages as an HTML table.</p>

<p>There is the ability to limit query sizes, which should be used.</p>
<!-- <h3>Incoming Messages Data Model</h3>
<p>
The data model for incoming messages looks like this:
 <table>
   <tr>
    <th>Field Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Allowed Values</th>
   </tr>
 </table>
</p> -->

<p>Here are two URLs that should get you going. Change 'view' to 'pull' when you are ready to 
pull messages from the queue rather than just viewing them.
<ul>
<li><a href="/msg/incoming/view?status=new&limit=10">/msg/incoming/view?status=new&limit=10</a></li>
<li><a href="/msg/incoming/view?status=new&limit=10&view_type=html">/msg/incoming/view?status=new&limit=10&view_type=html</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="outgoing">Outgoing Messages</a></h2>
<p>
Outgoing Messages are RID Messages that are to be sent to peers that 
implement the RID protocol. The outgoing messages store keeps messages
 that have been successfully sent for later viewing. Outgoing messages
are sent to the RID Agent by using the /msg/outgoing/push URL. The
 outgoing message store can be viewed by using the /msg/outgoing/view URL.
</p>
